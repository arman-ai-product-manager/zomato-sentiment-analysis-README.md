# Zomato Review Analysis – A Smart Way to Understand Customer Feelings

A friendly, story-style case study on how Zomato could use AI to analyze thousands of customer reviews using NLP (Natural Language Processing).

---

## The Problem

Imagine working at Zomato. Every day, thousands of reviews come in:

- "Loved the biryani!"
- "Delivery was too late!"

A team manually reading and analyzing all of them?  
That’s slow, boring, and doesn’t scale.

---

## The Smart Idea

Instead of reading reviews manually, the Zomato team built an NLP model to understand:

- What customers felt (sentiment)
- What issue they had (if any)
- What they praised

This helped them auto-tag every review intelligently.

## How It Works

| User Review | AI Tags |
|-------------|---------|
| “The pizza was cold and the delivery guy was rude.” | Negative Sentiment, Cold Food, Delivery Issue |
| “Amazing sushi! Super quick delivery!” | Positive Sentiment, Food Quality, Fast Delivery |

---

## Results

- 90% reduction in manual effort  
- Instant feedback to restaurant teams  
- Improved delivery and food quality  
- AI keeps learning from new reviews

---

## What’s Next?

Zomato could expand this system by:

- Showing auto-summarized reviews to users  
- Notifying restaurant partners of negative trends  
- Using AI to flag fake or spam reviews

---

## The Takeaway

By using AI to listen better, Zomato:

- Saved time  
- Made smarter decisions  
- Created a better experience for everyone

Sometimes, just listening — even through a machine — can make all the difference.
